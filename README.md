I only put this program as my tool in decrypting the **BIP-38** encrypted private key feature on the Bitcoin Papper wallet. Which you can also create from the official Bitcoin papper wallet creation page https://www.bitaddress.org/ by utilising this feature then by utilising the BIP-38 encrypted private key papper wallet users will be more secure in storing their paper wallets with an additional **passphrase** as a layer of security.
